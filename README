My Changes
------------

I added functions for fullscreening the focused window and toggling the 
border of windows. I added border toggling because existing patches for 
removing borders like "noborder" seemed buggy and were only meant
for removing the border of windows when there was only one on screen.

Bindings (META key is Alt):

META + X = close window (x out)
META + E = fullscreen focused window (enlarge)
META + N = toggle window border (no border)
META + C = open "urxvt" terminal (command line)
META + A = open "pavucontrol" (audio volume sliders)
META + Z = open "pcmanfm" file manager (zearch filesystem)

Below is the original dwm readme:





dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
